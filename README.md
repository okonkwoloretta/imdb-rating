# IMDB Top-Rated Movies Web Scraping Project
This project involves scraping data from the IMDB website to retrieve information about the top-rated movies. The data is then analyzed and visualized to gain insights into the highest-rated movies over the years.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the IMDB website and collect information about the top-rated movies listed on their chart. The data collected includes the movie rank, name, year of release, and IMDB rating. The project consists of two main components:

## Web Scraping: 
Python scripts are used to scrape the necessary data from the IMDB website. The BeautifulSoup library is utilized to parse the HTML content, and the requests library is used to fetch the webpage content with a user-agent header to mimic a regular browser request.

## Data Analysis and Visualization:
After scraping the data, it is saved in an Excel file using the openpyxl library. The Excel file is then imported into Power BI Power Query for further data cleaning and processing. Power BI is used to create interactive visualizations and gain insights into the top-rated movies.
